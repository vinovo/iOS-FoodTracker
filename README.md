[Introduction:]

create and add meals to the meal table. Upon setting up or editting a meal, user can specify the meal name, select a photo from
the gallery and rate the meal from 1 star to 5 stars.  
 	*The adapted version contain features that allow user to write a nutrition fact list of the meal and plan a meal by choosing
meals from the meal table. The app will automatically give a nutrition feedback about the meal plan.*
